The Sixth Basic Programming Experiment of the University<br>

❑ Experiment topic:<br>
Multi-file function operation.<br>
❑ Test type:<br>
comprehensive.<br>
❑ Experiment purpose:<br>
master the characteristics of function transfer parameters and the call relationship between functions. Master the definition and call of multi-file functions.<br>
❑ Experiment content:<br>
each student has 2 grades, input the scores of a group of students, sort them from high to low, and output the sorted results.<br>
❑ Requirements:<br>
input score, sorting, output sorting result and main program (main function) are in four files respectively, belonging to one project.<br>

❑ Extension training:<br>
1. Output the student ranking together.<br>
2. Find the score of the specified rank and output it.<br>

❑ Thinking: <br>
If the student's student number, name and other information are also entered, how to define the data storage, that is, the data structure.<br>
